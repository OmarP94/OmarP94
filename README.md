**`Developer`** **`Video Editor(VFX/Animator)`**

I'm an indie game and full-stack developer building my version of the digital world one step at a time. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm glad you're here!
